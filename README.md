
I was simply following the steps laid out by the project instructions, which said that the R script should:

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.

Most of the steps took less than 3 lines so by simply reading through the script step by step (especially with codebook explaining the variables) one can easily understand how it works.
